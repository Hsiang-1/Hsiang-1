- 🏛 I’m a student. My major is IoT Engineering. (Computer, Automation, Communication, Electronic, Artificial Intelligence...)
- 👨‍🎓 I’m learning Intelligent Algorithm(ML/DL/PRAI), which is my target for the next stage. I'm just a beginner!
- 📖 I’m also learning Algebra, Probability & Statistics, and a little Graph Theory. I think it's necessary, challenging but interesting.
- 🌱 I used to learn SLAM & Fusion Navigation, Intelligent Robot, Embedded System, C/C++ and some Algorithm.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on some small projects in hardware (Embedded) or software (C++/Python). We can enjoy it together!

- 🎮 Games: War Thunder, Hearts of Iron IV, Cities Skylines, Minecraft, Dyson Sphere Program, Civilization VI... (Strategy/Paradox Fan)
- ⚡ Fun fact: There are many things I still need to learn, we can learn and improve together!
- 🍓 [Here](http://sxlearning.xyz) is my original learning site. And I prepare to create a new site for both learning & living in my spare time.
